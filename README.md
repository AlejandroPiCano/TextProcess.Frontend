# Description

This project is a Frontend of TextProcessBackend in my repo.
It consists of being able to order words given a text separated by spaces and also to obtain statistics such as the number of words among others

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.1.3.

## Development server

-Execute `npm install` to restore all npm packages.
-Run `npm start` or ` ng serve --proxy-config proxy.conf.json --open` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

At the moment I have only carried out the tests of the service that connects with the API (TextProcessService)
